course_name: ECE469 - Operating Systems Engineering
course_description: "This course teaches how internals of modern operating systems are working with
hardware/software stack. In the course, we will learn fundamental concepts of operating systems by
building an operating system by our own hand. In particular, Labs are based on JOS, an educational OS project,
and will build it starting from booting (lab1), to virtual memory (lab2), to process (lab3),
to multi-tasking (lab4), and, finally File system, Spawn and Shell (lab5).
We will also covers concurrency issues in systems by learning on how to
implement locks and other synchronization mechanisms and how to resolve deadlock issues."


evaluation: "
We will use the following distribution for grading:
<ul>
  <li>Labs (Total: 70%).</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Lab 1 (3%)</li>
  <li>Lab 2 (8%)</li>
  <li>Lab 3 (14%)</li>
  <li>Lab 4 (20%)</li>
  <li>Lab 5 (25%)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>10 Quizzes (Total (Maximum): 10%) --- 5 top scoring quizzes will be used for grading</li>
  <ul>
  <li> Attempting a Quiz (1% each) --- Maximum 5% </li>
  <li> Quiz score (1% each) --- Maximum 5% --- Only top 5 highest scores will be considered</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Midterm (10%).</li>
  <li>Final (10%).</li>
  <li>Some extra credits in JOS Labs (1% or 2% each).</li>
</ul>
This is an implementation heavy and relatively tough course with more than one-third of the grade depends on the successful
completion of the labs.

<p/>

<p><b>Grading Policy</b></p>
Problems regarding grading of assignments and the midterm exam must be resolved within <b>one week</b> after the graded
work has been returned to you. It is your responsibility to pick up the graded work on time.
The grades will not be modified after the one week period.

Normally, the TAs make the final decisions on assigning the grade for each assignment and each exam question.
Therefore, any issues with grading should normally be resolved with the TAs. However, if a student
believes the TA's solution is wrong for a certain problem, he or she can ask the instructor for clarification.

<p/>

<p><b>Make-Up Exam Policy</b></p>
A make-up exam is given only in the most extreme circumstances and requires certification for such
circumstances: e.g. medical doctor's statement certifying that the student is unable to attend the scheduled exam.
Any personal travels, load from work or from other classes, failed alarm clocks, or simply not being able to make it
to the exam will not be grounds for a make-up. If you have any recurring medical problems that may unexpectedly
prevent you from making it to class or exams, please obtain a doctor's statement certifying your circumstances.
"

course_project: "The goal of the course project is to enable students to experience various aspects of
software security research.  The result of the project will be a conference-style presentation.
This is a semester-long project and is recommended to be done in groups of up to three students.
Each project group is expected to decide milestones and will receive grades based on the satisfactory
completion of these milestones and the presentation. Potential project ideas are
<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tmm2GvXN-9Uo8grPoXuJoPQM2JYPeSCf8a16RkJmFkA/\">here</a>.
Although, students can pick a project of their choice after discussing it with the professor."

course_prereqs: "
This is going to be an implementation heavy course with following pre-requisites.
<ul>
<li>ECE368 (Data Structures)</li>
<li>[Optional but highly recommended] ECE437 (Introduction to Digital Computer Design and Prototyping)</li>
</ul>
<b>Programming proficiency in C is absolutely required.</b>
"

learning_objectives: "The student will, upon completion of this course, understand basic operating system concepts.
In particular, the student should become familiar with the techniques used within UNIX-derived operating systems.
The associated laboratory experience augments this conceptual understanding of operating system design and construction
by giving the student \"hands-on\" experience. Projects will be implemented using networked personal
computers running Linux, a \"freeware\" version of POSIX-complaint UNIX.
"

course_policies: "As a student at Purdue you are subject to the
<i><a href=\"http://www.purdue.edu/studentregulations/student_conduct/index.html\">Purdue University Student Code of Conduct</a></i>,
which enjoins you to respect the highest standards of honesty and integrity. All work that you submit in this
course must be your own; unauthorized group efforts are considered academic dishonesty.
See the online brochure <i><a href=\"https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/academic-integrity-brochure/\">Academic Integrity A Guide for Students</a></i> for definitions and sanctions.
Academic dishonesty is a serious offense which may result in suspension or expulsion from the University.
In addition to any other action taken, such as suspension or expulsion, a <b>grade of F</b> will normally be recorded on the transcripts
of students found responsible for acts of academic dishonesty. Students are encouraged to report academic dishonesty
to the instructor directly, or to the <a href=\"http://www.purdue.edu/odos/\">Office of the Dean of Students</a>.

<p><b>Exams</b></p>
You must solve the exam problems yourself, without any help (knowing or unknowing) from any other student.
You must not seek any knowledge in advance of the test questions (beyond that given
in class), and must report any advance knowledge of the test questions by any
student that you are aware of. You must not allow any other student access to
your solutions during an exam. If the seating situation makes this difficult,
please inform the instructor or the TAs.

<p/>

<p><b>Programming Assignments</b></p>
Students are encouraged to talk to the TAs or the instructor on programming assignments.

You may discuss assignments in a general way with other students, for example, via the class mailing list, but you must
not consult any one else's written work. No discussion of or sharing of specific code or written answers is allowed,
and each team of students must write their own solution to the problem. Any sources used outside of the class
textbook/handouts/lectures must be explicitly acknowledged at the top of the assignment affected.

Note this policy requires you to protect your files against electronic copying using UNIX file protection, to not
place your work on any publicly accessible site, and to exercise care in the disposal of any printouts of your work.

Automatic tools will be used to compare your programming solutions to those of every other current or past student.

<p><b>The first case of cheating on an assignment will result in a zero for the particular assignment and reporting the
student to the university administration for disciplinary action.
The second case of cheating will result in an immediate F grade for the course.</b></p>

<p><b>Use of ChatGPT and LLMs:</b></p>

Using ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot <b>is not recommended for your coding assignments</b>.
The labs are well-structured, and completing them helps you better understand OS concepts.
<b>However, if you do use it, please mention the prompt used in the comments. For instance, <code>//LLMPROMPT: convert str to an integer.</code></b>
You will not be penalized for using ChatGPT or other LLMs.
