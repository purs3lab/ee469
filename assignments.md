The operating system you will build, called *JOS*, will have Unix-like
functions, but is implemented in an [ExoKernel](static_files/read/exokernel:sosp95.pdf) style (i.e., the
functions are implemented mostly as user-level library instead of
built-in to the kernel).

The labs used in this course are largely based on the materials originally
developed for [MIT 6.828: Operating System Engineering](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/index.html)
and edited by [OSU CS 444/544](https://os2.unexploitable.systems/index.html).

**The labs are done in pairs. Please make sure that you enroll along with your partner in a group on Brightspace.**
