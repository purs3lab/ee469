# Introduction

In this lab, you will write the memory management code for your
operating system. Memory management has two components.

The first component is a physical memory allocator for the kernel, so
that the kernel can allocate memory and later free it. Your allocator
will operate in units of 4096 bytes, called *pages*. Your task will be
to maintain data structures that record which physical pages are free
and which are allocated, and how many processes are sharing each
allocated page. You will also write the routines to allocate and free
pages of memory.

The second component of memory management is *virtual memory*, which
maps the virtual addresses used by kernel and user software to addresses
in physical memory. The x86 hardware's memory management unit (MMU)
performs the mapping when instructions use memory, consulting a set of
page tables. You will modify JOS to set up the MMU's page tables
according to a specification we provide.


# Getting started

In this and future labs you will progressively build up your kernel. We
will also provide you with some additional source. To fetch that source,
use Git to commit changes you've made since handing in lab 1 (if any),
fetch the latest version of the course repository, and then create a
local branch called ``lab2`` based on our lab2 branch, ``origin/lab2``:

```
$ cd ~/jos
$ git pull
Already up-to-date.
$ git checkout -b lab2 origin/lab2
Branch lab2 set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/lab2.
Switched to a new branch "lab2"
$
```

The ``git checkout -b`` command shown above actually does two things: it
first creates a local branch ``lab2`` that is based on the
``origin/lab2`` branch provided by the course staff, and second, it
changes the contents of your ``lab`` directory to reflect the files
stored on the ``lab2`` branch. Git allows switching between existing
branches using git checkout *branch-name*, though you should commit any
outstanding changes on one branch before switching to a different one.

You will now need to merge the changes you made in your ``lab1`` branch
into the ``lab2`` branch, as follows:

```
$ git merge lab1
Merge made by recursive.
 kern/kdebug.c  |   11 +++++++++--
 kern/monitor.c |   19 +++++++++++++++++++
 lib/printfmt.c |    7 +++----
 3 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)
$
```

In some cases, Git may not be able to figure out how to merge your
changes with the new lab assignment (e.g. if you modified some of the
code that is changed in the second lab assignment). In that case, the
git merge command will tell you which files are *conflicted*, and you
should first resolve the conflict (by editing the relevant files) and
then commit the resulting files with ``git commit -a``.

Lab 2 contains the following new source files, which you should browse
through:

- ``inc/memlayout.h``
- ``kern/pmap.c``
- ``kern/pmap.h``
- ``kern/kclock.h``
- ``kern/kclock.c``

``memlayout.h`` describes the layout of the virtual address space that
you must implement by modifying ``pmap.c``. ``memlayout.h`` and
``pmap.h`` define the ``PageInfo`` structure that you'll use to keep
track of which pages of physical memory are free. ``kclock.c`` and
``kclock.h`` manipulate the PC's battery-backed clock and CMOS RAM
hardware, in which the BIOS records the amount of physical memory the PC
contains, among other things. The code in ``pmap.c`` needs to read this
device hardware in order to figure out how much physical memory there
is, but that part of the code is done for you: you do not need to know
the details of how the CMOS hardware works.

Pay particular attention to ``memlayout.h`` and ``pmap.h``, since this
lab requires you to use and understand many of the definitions they
contain. You may want to review ``inc/mmu.h``, too, as it also contains
a number of definitions that will be useful for this lab.

# Lab Requirements

In this lab and subsequent labs, do all of the regular exercises
described in the lab and provide a writeup that briefly answers
to the questions posed in the lab.
Please place the write-up in a file called
``answers-lab2.txt`` in the top level of your
directory before handing in your work.

# Hand-In Procedure

When you are ready to hand in your lab code and write-up, add your
``answers-lab2.txt`` to the Git repository, commit your changes, and
then tag your commit with ``lab2-final`` as the final to submit the lab.

```
$ git add answers-lab2.txt
$ git commit -am "my answer to lab2"
[lab2 a823de9] my answer to lab2
 4 files changed, 87 insertions(+), 10 deletions(-)
$ make grade # check your result!
$ make handin
```

Now upload your `lab2-handin.tar.gz` as the submission for your group.

As before, we will be grading your solutions with a grading program. You
can run ``make grade`` to test your kernel with the
grading program. You may change any of the kernel source and header
files you need to in order to complete the lab, but needless to say you
must not change or otherwise subvert the grading code.

# Part 1: Physical Page Management

The operating system must keep track of which parts of physical RAM are
free and which are currently in use. JOS manages the PC's physical
memory with *page granularity* so that it can use the MMU to map and
protect each piece of allocated memory.


You'll now write the physical page allocator. It keeps track of which
pages are free with a linked list of ``struct PageInfo`` objects (which,
unlike xv6, are *not* embedded in the free pages themselves), each
corresponding to a physical page. You need to write the physical page
allocator before you can write the rest of the virtual memory
implementation, because your page table management code will need to
allocate physical memory in which to store page tables.

## <span style="color:blue">Exercise 1</span>
> In the file ``kern/pmap.c``, you must implement code for the
following functions (probably in the order given).
```
boot_alloc()
mem_init() (only up to the call to check_page_free_list(1))
page_init()
page_alloc()
page_free()
```
> ``check_page_free_list()`` and ``check_page_alloc()`` test your physical
page allocator. You should boot JOS and see whether
``check_page_alloc()`` reports success. Fix your code so that it passes.
You may find it helpful to add your own ``assert()`` to verify that
your assumptions are correct.

This lab, and all the EE469 labs, will require you to do a bit of
detective work to figure out exactly what you need to do. This
assignment does not describe all the details of the code you'll have to
add to JOS. Look for comments in the parts of the JOS source that you
have to modify; those comments often contain specifications and hints.
You will also need to look at related parts of JOS, at the Intel
manuals.

# Part 2: Virtual Memory

Before doing anything else, familiarize yourself with the x86's
protected-mode memory management architecture: namely *segmentation* and
*page translation*.

## <span style="color:blue">Exercise 2</span>
> Look at chapters 5 and 6 of the
[Intel 80386 Reference Manual](http://www.logix.cz/michal/doc/i386/),
if you haven't done so already.
Read the sections about page translation and page-based protection
closely (5.2 and 6.4). We recommend that you also skim the sections
about segmentation; while JOS uses paging for virtual memory and
protection, segment translation and segment-based protection cannot be
disabled on the x86, so you will need a basic understanding of it.

## Virtual, Linear, and Physical Addresses

In x86 terminology, a *virtual address* consists of a segment selector
and an offset within the segment. A *linear address* is what you get
after segment translation but before page translation. A *physical
address* is what you finally get after both segment and page translation
and what ultimately goes out on the hardware bus to your RAM.

```
               Selector  +--------------+         +-----------+
              ---------->|              |         |           |
                         | Segmentation |         |  Paging   |
    Software             |              |-------->|           |---------->  RAM
                Offset   |  Mechanism   |         | Mechanism |
              ---------->|              |         |           |
                         +--------------+         +-----------+
                Virtual                   Linear                Physical

```
A C pointer is the "offset" component of the virtual address. In
``boot/boot.S``, we installed a Global Descriptor Table (GDT) that
effectively disabled segment translation by setting all segment base
addresses to 0 and limits to ``0xffffffff``. Hence the "selector" has no
effect and the linear address always equals the offset of the virtual
address. In lab 3, we'll have to interact a little more with
segmentation to set up privilege levels, but as for memory translation,
we can ignore segmentation throughout the JOS labs and focus solely on
page translation.

Recall that in part 3 of lab 1, we installed a simple page table so that
the kernel could run at its link address of 0xf0100000, even though it
is actually loaded in physical memory just above the ROM BIOS at
0x00100000. This page table mapped only 4MB of memory. In the virtual
memory layout you are going to set up for JOS in this lab, we'll expand
this to map the first 256MB of physical memory starting at virtual
address 0xf0000000 and to map a number of other regions of virtual
memory.

## <span style="color:blue">Exercise 3</span>
> While GDB can only access QEMU's memory by virtual address,
it's often useful to be able to inspect physical memory while setting up
virtual memory. Review the QEMU
[monitor commands](../00_assignment)
from the lab tools guide,
especially the ``xp`` command, which lets you inspect physical memory.
To access the QEMU monitor, press ``Ctrl-a c`` in the terminal (the same
binding returns to the serial console).

> Use the ``xp`` command in the QEMU monitor and the ``x`` command in GDB to
inspect memory at corresponding physical and virtual addresses and make
sure you see the same data.

From code executing on the CPU, once we're in protected mode (which we
entered first thing in ``boot/boot.S``, there's no way to directly use
a linear or physical address. *All* memory references are interpreted as
virtual addresses and translated by the MMU, which means all pointers in
C are virtual addresses.

The JOS kernel often needs to manipulate addresses as opaque values or
as integers, without dereferencing them, for example in the physical
memory allocator. Sometimes these are virtual addresses, and sometimes
they are physical addresses. To help document the code, the JOS source
distinguishes the two cases: the type ``uintptr_t`` represents opaque
virtual addresses, and ``physaddr_t`` represents physical addresses.
Both these types are really just synonyms for 32-bit integers
(``uint32_t``), so the compiler won't stop you from assigning one type
to another! Since they are integer types (not pointers), the compiler
*will* complain if you try to dereference them.

The JOS kernel can dereference a ``uintptr_t`` by first casting it to a
pointer type. In contrast, the kernel can't sensibly dereference a
physical address, since the MMU translates all memory references. If you
cast a ``physaddr_t`` to a pointer and dereference it, you may be able
to load and store to the resulting address (the hardware will interpret
it as a virtual address), but you probably won't get the memory location
you intended.

To summarize:

    +--------------------+----------------+
    | C type             | Address type   |
    +====================+================+
    | ``T*``             | Virtual        |
    +--------------------+----------------+
    | ``uintptr_t``      | Virtual        |
    +--------------------+----------------+
    | ``physaddr_t``     | Physical       |
    +--------------------+----------------+


Assuming that the following JOS kernel code is correct, what type 
should variable ``x`` have, ``uintptr_t`` or ``physaddr_t``?
```
mystery_t x;
char* value = return_a_pointer();
*value = 10;
x = (mystery_t) value;
```

The JOS kernel sometimes needs to read or modify memory for which it
knows only the physical address. For example, adding a mapping to a page
table may require allocating physical memory to store a page directory
and then initializing that memory. However, the kernel, like any other
software, cannot bypass virtual memory translation and thus cannot
directly load and store to physical addresses. One reason JOS remaps of
all of physical memory starting from physical address 0 at virtual
address 0xf0000000 is to help the kernel read and write memory for which
it knows just the physical address. In order to translate a physical
address into a virtual address that the kernel can actually read and
write, the kernel must add 0xf0000000 to the physical address to find
its corresponding virtual address in the remapped region. You should use
``KADDR(pa)`` to do that addition.

The JOS kernel also sometimes needs to be able to find a physical
address given the virtual address of the memory in which a kernel data
structure is stored. Kernel global variables and memory allocated by
``boot_alloc()`` are in the region where the kernel was loaded, starting
at ``0xf0000000``, the very region where we mapped all of physical memory.
Thus, to turn a virtual address in this region into a physical address,
the kernel can simply subtract ``0xf0000000``. You should use ``PADDR(va)``
to do that subtraction.

## Reference counting

In future labs you will often have the same physical page mapped at
multiple virtual addresses simultaneously (or in the address spaces of
multiple environments). You will keep a count of the number of
references to each physical page in the ``pp_ref`` field of the
``struct PageInfo`` corresponding to the physical page. When this count
goes to zero for a physical page, that page can be freed because it is
no longer used. In general, this count should equal to the number of
times the physical page appears *below ``UTOP``* in all page tables (the
mappings above ``UTOP`` are mostly set up at boot time by the kernel and
should never be freed, so there's no need to reference count them).
We'll also use it to keep track of the number of pointers we keep to the
page directory pages and, in turn, of the number of references the page
directories have to page table pages.

Be careful when using ``page_alloc``. The page it returns will always
have a reference count of 0, so ``pp_ref`` should be incremented as soon
as you've done something with the returned page (like inserting it into
a page table). Sometimes this is handled by other functions (for
example, ``page_insert``) and sometimes the function calling
``page_alloc`` must do it directly.

## Page Table Management

Now you'll write a set of routines to manage page tables: to insert and
remove linear-to-physical mappings, and to create page table pages when
needed.

## <span style="color:blue">Exercise 4</span>
> In the file ``kern/pmap.c``, you must implement code for the
following functions.
```
pgdir_walk()
boot_map_region()
page_lookup()
page_remove()
page_insert()
```
> ``check_page()``, called from ``mem_init()``, tests your page table
management routines. You should make sure it reports success before
proceeding.

# Part 3: Kernel Address Space

JOS divides the processor's 32-bit linear address space into two parts.
User environments (processes), which we will begin loading and running
in lab 3, will have control over the layout and contents of the lower
part, while the kernel always maintains complete control over the upper
part. The dividing line is defined somewhat arbitrarily by the symbol
``ULIM`` in ``inc/memlayout.h``, reserving approximately 256MB of
virtual address space for the kernel. This explains why we needed to
give the kernel such a high link address in lab 1: otherwise there would
not be enough room in the kernel's virtual address space to map in a
user environment below it at the same time.

You'll find it helpful to refer to the JOS memory layout diagram in
``inc/memlayout.h`` both for this part and for later labs.

## Permissions and Fault Isolation

Since kernel and user memory are both present in each environment's
address space, we will have to use permission bits in our x86 page
tables to allow user code access only to the user part of the address
space. Otherwise bugs in user code might overwrite kernel data, causing
a crash or more subtle malfunction; user code might also be able to
steal other environments' private data.

The user environment will have no permission to any of the memory above
``ULIM``, while the kernel will be able to read and write this memory.
For the address range ``[UTOP,ULIM)``, both the kernel and the user
environment have the same permission: they can read but not write this
address range. This range of address is used to expose certain kernel
data structures read-only to the user environment. Lastly, the address
space below ``UTOP`` is for the user environment to use; the user
environment will set permissions for accessing this memory.

## Initializing the Kernel Address Space

Now you'll set up the address space above ``UTOP``: the kernel part of
the address space. ``inc/memlayout.h`` shows the layout you should use.
You'll use the functions you just wrote to set up the appropriate linear
to physical mappings.

## <span style="color:blue">Exercise 5</span>
> Fill in the missing code in ``mem_init()`` after the call to
``check_page()``.

> Your code should now pass the ``check_kern_pgdir()`` and
``check_page_installed_pgdir()`` checks.

> **Questions**

>  a.  What entries (rows) in the page directory have been filled in at this
point? What addresses do they map and where do they point? In other
words, fill out this table as much as possible:

        |Entry| Base Virtual Address |  Points to (logically)                |

>  b.  We have placed the kernel and user environment in the same address
       space. Why will user programs not be able to read or write the
       kernel's memory? What specific mechanisms protect the kernel memory?

>  c.  What is the maximum amount of physical memory that this operating
       system can support? Why?

>  d.  How much space overhead is there for managing memory, if we actually
       had the maximum amount of physical memory? How is this overhead
       broken down?

>  e.  Revisit the page table setup in ``kern/entry.S`` and
       ``kern/entrypgdir.c``. Immediately after we turn on paging, EIP is
       still a low number (a little over 1MB). At what point do we
       transition to running at an EIP above KERNBASE? What makes it
       possible for us to continue executing at a low EIP between when we
       enable paging and when we begin running at an EIP above KERNBASE? Why
       is this transition necessary?


## <span style="color:green">Challenge (Extra Credit: 1%)</span>
> Extend the JOS kernel monitor with commands to:

> -  Display in a useful and easy-to-read format all of the physical page
   mappings (or lack thereof) that apply to a particular range of
   virtual/linear addresses in the currently active address space. For
   example, you might enter ``'showmappings 0x3000 0x5000'`` to display
   the physical page mappings and corresponding permission bits that
   apply to the pages at virtual addresses ``0x3000``, ``0x4000``, and ``0x5000``.
> -  Explicitly set, clear, or change the permissions of any mapping in
   the current address space.
> -  Dump the contents of a range of memory given either a virtual or
   physical address range. Be sure the dump code behaves correctly when
   the range extends across page boundaries!
> -  Do anything else that you think might be useful later for debugging
   the kernel. (There's a good chance it will be!)

> -  Once you finish this, please create a file ``.lab2-extra`` at the root of
   your repository directory (under ``jos/``). We will use that file as an
   indicator that you finished this extra-credit and then grade your work
   accordingly.

## Address Space Layout Alternatives

The address space layout we use in JOS is not the only one possible. An
operating system might map the kernel at low linear addresses while
leaving the *upper* part of the linear address space for user processes.
x86 kernels generally do not take this approach, however, because one of
the x86's backward-compatibility modes, known as *virtual 8086 mode*, is
"hard-wired" in the processor to use the bottom part of the linear
address space, and thus cannot be used at all if the kernel is mapped
there.

It is even possible, though much more difficult, to design the kernel so
as not to have to reserve *any* fixed portion of the processor's linear
or virtual address space for itself, but instead effectively to allow
allow user-level processes unrestricted use of the *entire* 4GB of
virtual address space - while still fully protecting the kernel from
these processes and protecting different processes from each other!
